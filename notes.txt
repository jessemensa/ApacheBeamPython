APACHE BEAM MAIN CONCEPTS TO REMEMBER 

1. MAIN CONCEPTS OF THE BEAM MODEL 
PIPELINE => GRAPH OF TRANSFORMATIONS THAT DEFINES DESIRED DATA PROCESSING OPERATIONS. 
PCOLLECTION => IS A DATASET OR DATASTREAM 
PTRANSFORM =>  A PTransform (or transform) represents a data processing operation, or a step, in your pipeline
AGGREGATION => COMPUTING VALUE FROM ONE OR MULTIPLE INPUT ELEMENTS 
USER DEFINED FUNCTIONS => Some Beam operations allow you to run user-defined code as a way to configure the transform.
THIS IS WHERE FUNCTIONS CAN BE APPLIED HERE 
SCHEMA => ELEMENTS INSIDE A PCOLLECTION 
SDK => IE PYTHON, GOLANG 
A language-specific library that lets pipeline authors build transforms, 
construct their pipelines, and submit them to a runner.
RUNNER => RUNS BEAM PIPELINES USING THE CAPABILITIES OF CHOSEN DATA PROCESSING ENGINE 
WINDOW =>  Windows enable grouping operations over collections that grow over time by dividing 
the collection into windows of finite collections
WATERMARK => Watermark - A watermark is a guess as to when all data in a certain 
window is expected to have arrived. 
TRIGGER => A TRIGGER DETERMINES WHEN TO AGGREGATE RESULTS OF EACH WINDOW 
STATE AND FILTERS => 
Per-key state and timer callbacks are lower level primitives that give you full control 
over aggregating input collections that grow over time.

SPLITTABLE DOFN => Splittable DoFns let you process elements in a non-monolithic way.
